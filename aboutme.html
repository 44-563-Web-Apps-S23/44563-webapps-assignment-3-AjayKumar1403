        Interesting fact about me is I hate watching movies these days!!! From childhood I have been a 
        fan of movies and I used to watch them a lot. But later I realised that I spent all my life wasting 
        time watching movies and their illusions.

        This is the first book which I read. It is pretty good in explaining how to save money and
        invest in some assets not in liabilities. Once you read it you will understand the key to
        become rich is investing on something that gives you long turn returns.

                There are some parts of the world that, once visited, get into your heart and won’t go.
                For me, India is such a place. When I first visited, I was stunned by the richness
                of the land, by its lush beauty and exotic architecture, by its ability to overload 
                the senses with the pure, concentrated intensity of its colors, smells, tastes,
                and sounds… I had been seeing the world in black & white and, when brought face-to-face
                with India, experienced everything re-rendered in brilliant technicolor

                Singapore packs a surprisingly massive number of attractions:
                 verdant parks, world-class zoos, luxurious hotels, historical structures,
                  and deliciously cheap eats, all in a land area not much bigger than El Paso, 
                  Texas.

                Besides cheese and milk chocolate, which Switzerland makes the best of the best of,
                 the traditional cuisine will surprise you, not only with the ingredients of the dishes 
                 but also with a spectacular presentation of them on a plate. The foods can be described 
                 as descendants of Canton’s French, Italian, and Germanic dishes with a unique twist, 
                 which is most commonly achieved through adding home recipe spices, naturally aged 
                 ingredients, and a frequent contrast between sweet and light-bitterness that adds to 
                 the exquisite flavors. If you take interest in culinary arts or want to try new 
                 delicacies, then Switzerland has you covered, anywhere from casual cafes to Michelin 
                 star restaurants.

                the grandeur of Mt. Fuji, wrap yourself in the sacred atmosphere of age-old shrines and 
                temples, and fall in love with the seasons.
