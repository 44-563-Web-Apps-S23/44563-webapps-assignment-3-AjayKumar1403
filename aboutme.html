        Interesting fact about me is I hate watching movies these days!!! From childhood I have been a 
        fan of movies and I used to watch them a lot. But later I realised that I spent all my life wasting 
        time watching movies and their illusions.

        This is the first book which I read. It is pretty good in explaining how to save money and
        invest in some assets not in liabilities. Once you read it you will understand the key to
        become rich is investing on something that gives you long turn returns.
