    <p style="color: white;">If anything can be said about Jurassic World: Dominion, it's that there are a lot of dinosaurs.
         Seeing these monstrous reptiles in motion can be both terrifying and captivating. 
         Not only that, but the wide variety of dinosaurs on display in this particular installment 
         could really pique someone's curiosity; it's enough to make one want to go to their nearest 
         natural history museum and make a day out of the dinosaur exhibits. Anime fans might 
         alternatively want to check out some dinosaur-related anime.</p>
